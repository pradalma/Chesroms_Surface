# Chesroms_Surface

How to compile > on the surface, I am not setup for MPI, only for serial run as of May 2018.
to compile, go in /mnt/c/roms and execute .build.chesapeake.bash

I need to test the reproducibility of the results between the surface and the DELL.

in /mnt/c/roms/chesapeake/chesapeake.in around line 75, NtileI == 1 NtileJ==1
This is where to edit when running with MPI. Increase the number of threads I think.

At first, I thought the model was not running, but when it seems to be hung up, it can be because the exec command is not correct.
